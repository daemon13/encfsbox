usage: encfsbox <status|mount|umount|refresh|conflicts>

mount/unmount dropbox encfs filesystems, while checking for
conflicts. this script looks in the dropbox for directories prefixed
with enc_<dirname> and mounts the encfs filesystems as ~/<dirname>. If
enc_<dirname> is not an encfs filesystem it will prompt you to
initialise an encfs filesystem in that directory.

Dropbox conflict resolution is a problem when using encfs. The dropbox
mechanism of adding a conflict notification to the end of the
filename, breaks its encfs filename encoding, and so encfs ignores
it. 

When this script is run for conflict resolution, it will perform a
rename of the broken encfs filename, so that it will appear properly
in the decoded mount, e.g. if there is a conflict for 'filename', it
will rename the conflicyed file so that it creates the file "filename
(dummy conflicted copy 2012-03-27)" in the encfs mounted filesystem.

This script defaults to searching ${MNT_SEARCH_DEFAULT} for the encfs
root filesystems, but this can be changed by using the DROPBOX_DIR
environmental variable. If you can not set it in your bashrc, you can
specify it like this:

DROPBOX_DIR=~/Dropbox $0 mount

Commands:
status - display status of encfs mounts
mount - mount/create encfs filesystems
umount - unmount encfs filesystems
refresh - silently check status and mount/create encfs filesystems if unmounted.
conflicts - perform conflicted copy file resolution.
